# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Kaleab Assefa**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [*] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [*] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [*] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [*] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [*] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [*] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [*] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
I would imporve the life of player and add different patterns to make it more competitive. Adding more buttons can also make the game more playable and challenging. Different diffculty levels can make the game exciting. It means that the player can choose the diffculty level of the game, which means in the harder difficulty level it will have more and fast paterns and for easy diffulty level vise versa.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[The instruction were detailed but I needed to use W3 schools in order to complete the if statments task.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[In this assignment I had a little knowledge in JS and understanding the codes was the first challenge I encountered. I went to w3 school to learn the basic on html, CSS, and JavaScript codes to familiarize myself. Once I have done that then I started the assignments. After going on to writing the html and CSS file I got stuck in the Js so while debugging errors. The errors I have gotten was the sound would not come as it was instructed. while the button is clicked or showing the colors there were no sounds. I needed to review this problem and started to compare the tone codes with my code. I after reviewed the codes and try to identify the error in the script.js I was able to find the error which was a typing error. After I fixed that I tried my code many times before moving to the next steps of the submission process. While completing the submission I also found one more obstacle. Button 4 which was a light yellow was not turning to yellow after it was pressed by the player. This error was difficult to find but the error was a typing error which I wrote button4 as butoon4. It made me use more time than I should but finally the result was satisfactory. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[After completing the submission, I learned a lot and found it interesting. There are 3 basic languages on web development but there are many frames works and API needed to make it complete, and I wanted to ask why those are needed what are their purposes? while Java script can do many of them. Also, after completing the front end I wanted to know more about the back end of web development and what languages we going to use to build the backend. The code path internship program will help answer this question and become well rounded web developer.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Becuase of school assignments and classes I wasn't able to complete any additional features.]
